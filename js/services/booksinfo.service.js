    Melange, or 'spice', is the most valuable - and rarest - element in the universe; a drug that does 
    everything from increasing a person's life-span to making intersteller travel possible. And it can only 
    be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world Arrakis. \n\n
    Whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. \n\n
    And whoever controls the spice controls the universe. \n\n
    When the Emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides, 
    the Harkonnens fight back, murdering Duke Leto Atreides. Paul, his son, and Lady Jessica, his concubine, 
    flee into the desert. On the point of death, they are rescued by a band for Fremen, the native 
    people of Arrakis, who control Arrakis' second great resource: the giant worms that burrow beneath 
    the burning desert sands.\n\n
    In order to avenge his father and retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens, Paul must earn the trust of 
    the Fremen and lead a tiny army against the innumerable forces aligned against them. 
    And his journey will change the universe`;

    Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\n\n
    In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies 
    breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew Ender Wiggin lives with 
    his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, 
    his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't 
    make the cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.\n\n
    
    Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock 
    battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers 
    greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling 
    fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like 
    the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.\n\n
    Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. 
    The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect 
    general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual 
    as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. 
    If, that is, the world survives.`;

    The Foundation series is Isaac Asimov's iconic masterpiece. Unfolding against the backdrop of a

    thriving Empire is rotten, until psychohistorian Hari Seldon uses his new science to foresee its terrible fate. \n\n

    recently deceased under mysterious circumstances. He soon discovers the existence of a cult that worships 
    ancient and unspeakable horrors. Mysterious murders, blood rituals in the depths of the Louisiana swamps, 
    artists who descend into insanity after nightmarish visions, and a Cyclopean city that rises from the sea. 
    Step by step, Thurston realizes that his relative's research got too close to the truth. In the shadows, 
    there are those who want to wake the sleeping god Cthulhu in order to spread madness and destruction over 
    the entire world. The stars are right. Is the end near? \n\n

    H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, first published in 1928, is one of the greatest classics of American 
    horror literature. Cthulhu himself, dreaming and waiting at the bottom of the sea, became a symbol for the 
    entire mythology that Lovecraft created. \n\n
    
    Fran√ßois Baranger, an illustrator who has previously worked in film and games, was fascinated early on by Lovecraft's 
    creatures and visions which populated the darkest recesses of fantasy. In this book, he has taken on the work of 
    illustrating Lovecraft's most iconic novel.`;

    With its strange, imaginative blend of horror, science fiction, romance and lyrical prose, Robert W. Chambers' 
    The King in Yellow is a classic masterpiece of weird fiction. This series of vaguely connected stories is linked 
    by the presence of a monstrous and suppressed book which brings fright, madness and spectral tragedy to all 
    those who read it. An air of futility and doom pervade these pages like a sweet insidious poison. Dare you read it? \n\n\n
    This collection has been called the most important book in American supernatural fiction between Poe and the moderns. 
    H. P. Lovecraft, creator of the famed Cthulu mythos, whose own fiction was greatly influenced by this book stated 
    that The King in Yellow 'achieves notable heights of cosmic fear'.`;
